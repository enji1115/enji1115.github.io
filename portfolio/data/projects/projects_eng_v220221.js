            <span> I provided guidelines because the outsourced developer's Canvas control and scroll transition handling ability were insufficient. Due to development schedule issues, I took charge of the pages that required the technology.</span>

            <span> At the beginning, there was a request to simulate in 3D, so I tried it, but it seems impossible to use it in practice, so I suggested a transition that gives a sense of empathy depending on the mouse position as an alternative effect.

            <span> I have created a product detail page to introduce new products. We proposed a way to visually express the technology of the product as a prototype. I used an image sequence to give it the effect of playing a video as it scrolls.</span>

            <span> In a situation where the technology of the product needs to be effectively expressed within a short schedule, a method to express the technology of the product was suggested by making a prototype from the initial planning stage to create the best work. The prototype helped the planners and designers with their ideas, and when the actual work was carried out, the prototype was used to shorten the work time.</span>
            <span> An issue occurred in which the loading of the image sequence according to the scrolling of the intro section was delayed on the actual server differently from the test page. I solved it by halving the number of images and playing the video in some browsers.</span>
